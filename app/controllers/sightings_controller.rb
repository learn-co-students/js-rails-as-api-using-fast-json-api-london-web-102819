Setting these relationships up in SightingSerializer is necessary for the second step. 
Now that we have included relationships connecting the SightingSerializer to :bird and :location, 
to include attributes from those objects, 
the recommended method is to pass in a second options parameter to the serializer indicating that we want to include those objects:
=end   
    options = {
      include: [:bird, :location]
    }

    render json: SightingSerializer.new(sighting, options)
=begin
ðŸ‘†Because we have a BirdSerializer and a LocationSerializer, 
when including :bird and :location, 
Fast JSON API will automatically serialize their attributes as well.
